## About Me

I will begin as an Assistant Professor Department of Urban Studies and Planning and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society at MIT in July 2026! Please reach out to me if you are interested in hearing more about my work and future lab. 

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Ka Moamoa Lab](https://kamoamoa.com) at Georgia Tech and a 2025-2026 NSF [ICICLE Educational Fellow](https://icicle.osu.edu/education-and-outreach/icicle-educational-fellows-program). My primary research project is focused on designing and deploying low-cost sensing devices to monitor environmental factors of _Manoomin_, wild rice that grows in the Great Lakes region and is essential to Indigenous North American culture, economy, and sustenance. This work is part of the multi-institute [Strong Manoomin Collective](https://www.manoom.in), which is funded by multiple NSF grants.

I earned a PhD in Computer Science from Harvard University, where I was co-advised by [Jim Waldo](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~waldo/) and [Amy Mueller](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/mueller-amy/) and selected as a 2024 [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/articles/siebel-scholars-foundation-announces-class-of-2024/) and [CPS Rising Star](https://risingstars.linklab.virginia.edu/2024/). My PhD research was focused on designing reliable, scalable, and equitable sensor networks for urban environmental sensing, and part of that work was recognized with a Best Poster Award at EWSN 2024. From 2020 to 2022, I was a member of the [Urban Innovation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/urban-innovation/) group at Microsoft Research, where I helped deploy and maintain the [Eclipse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-eclipse/) air quality sensing network.
