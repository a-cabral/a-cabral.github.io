## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Ka Moamoa Lab](https://kamoamoa.com) at Georgia Tech. My primary research project is focused on designing and deploying low-cost sensing devices to monitor environmental factors of _manoomin_, wild rice that grows in the Great Lakes region and is essential to Indigenous North American culture, economy, and sustenance. This work is part of the multi-institute [Strong Manoomin Collective](https://www.manoom.in), which is funded by multiple NSF grants.

I earned a PhD in Computer Science from Harvard University, where I was co-advised by [Jim Waldo](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~waldo/) and [Amy Mueller](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/mueller-amy/) and selected as a 2024 [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/articles/siebel-scholars-foundation-announces-class-of-2024/) and [CPS Rising Star](https://risingstars.linklab.virginia.edu/2024/). My PhD research was focused on designing reliable, scalable, and equitable sensor networks for urban environmental sensing. From 2020 to 2022, I was a member of the [Urban Innovation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/urban-innovation/) group at Microsoft Research, where I helped deploy and maintain the [Eclipse](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-eclipse/) air quality sensing network. 


## Research Interests
